    > Grow your Flower

Problem statement (i.e., what is the problem?)

    > A lot of college students plan their day around what they have to do for classes, readings to do and deadlines to meet. In the process, we tend to forget about self-care, and how important it is.  That is why we have designed a prototype for a self-care application.  

How do you solve the problem? 
> We create a little game to remind users to 

List of all the features that your team will implement (including which of the "Pick 4" items were chosen by the team). Your team will be held accountable for the features you list!

    > Geo-location 
    > Server-side data persistence
    > Front-end framework
    > Send emails, SMSes, or push notifications 

What data will your prototype be using and collecting

    > User's geo-location

Any algorithms or special techniques that will be necessary

Electronic mockups of what your team will be developing using wireframes. No hand-drawn mockups accepted. Tools to create wireframes include Balsamiq (commercial; de facto standard), Gliffy, MockFlow, and even Microsoft PowerPoint.
