What was accomplished during the week:

Cathy: Created a simple login page using the facebook API that posts some info about the user to the server to be used in our database.

Josie: 
1) setup mySQL and mySQL workbench locally 
2) modified our index.js (our web server) and added the mySQL dependency to 
    package.json
3) successfully connected to mysql locally and was able to execute a mysql query
    from index.js 
4) practiced making the tables for our app locally on mySQL workbench - was able to successfully store and pull data from the tables

Elif: I created a simple map with flower icons on hard-coded locations. 

Hannah: I used OpenWeather API to format the background photos and worked on CSS styling for the myGarden homepage.


Challenges faced during the week:

Cathy: Configuring API vars and figuring out where to put the keys.

Josie: Configuration!  There isn’t a ton of documentation for the figuration between clearDB, heroku, AND mySQL workbench.  A lot of time has been spent searching for useful information.  The best tutorial I found was on youtube (no sound but I was able to follow along) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=US_wEKuWZ0U

Goals for next week: 

Cathy: Making the login page prettier, and integrating it with our index page as a layover that redirects to the user’s homepage after they are logged in. 

Elif:  Get the flowers to be positioned in users’ locations

Josie: Once I have all the configuration setup, I will create the tables to be available on clearDB to connect to heroku.  Then, on the web server side in index.js, I need to prepare the queries and set up the POST endpoints to retrieve/send data from/to client/server.

Hannah: I will start the svg and d3 animations to grow the flowers in stages: seed, seedling, bud, flower!
